# ConformalMappingSympy 

This repository hosts code that illustrates the content of the presentation and proceeding *Conformal Mappings with Sympy: Towards Python-driven Analytical Modeling in Physics* a collaborative work of Lauer-Baré Z. and Gaertig E. presented on THE 20th PYTHON IN SCIENCE CONF. (SCIPY 2021).

Python scripts and jupyter notebooks are provided.

Please refer to "Lauer-Baré Z.and Gaertig E., Conformal Mappings with Sympy: Towards Python-driven Analytical Modeling in Physics,PROC. OF THE 20th PYTHON IN SCIENCE CONF. (SCIPY 2021)", when using formulae or code from this repository.

## Transformation of eccentric annulus to concentric annulus

```code_block_moebius.py``` and ```moebius.ipynb``` with a Möbius transform of the type

## Transformation of eccentric annulus to rectangle

```code_block_bipolar.py``` and ```bipolar.ipynb``` with a conformal mapping related to bipolar coordinates.

### Postprocessing

The postprocessing is shown in the file ```moebius.ipynb``` , due to LaTEX rendering of web browser based *jupyter notebook*.

Flow force calculation with ```diff``` and Taylor expansion of force in the gap
